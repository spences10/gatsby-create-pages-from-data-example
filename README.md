# Gatsby Create Pages from Data Example

Like Next.js you can generate pages from data with the
`createPagesFromData` which is in
`"gatsby": "^2.20.24-unifiedroutes.53",` this appears to still not
have made it into the main Gatsby project with no real indication of
when it will get merged.

Thanks to Benjamin Lannon for bringing it to my attention 🙏
